    <section class="row">
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3>1. Ladybird Nursery/primary school.</h3> Here, I had my nursery and primary school education between the ages of 2 and 9. I graduated in July 2008. The proprietress was Mrs. Amahoutu, a German woman. I was in "Jasmine" arm all through my stay. Other arms were "Lily", "Rose" and "Hibiscus".
      </div>
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3>2. Taqwa High school.</h3> Here, I had my Junior Secondary education between the years of 2008 and 2011. I took interest in the school because my Family friend, Aishah Giwa was there as well, although, she left a year after. It was a muslim school. On completing JSS3 (Basic 9), I moved to another school.
      </div>
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3>3. Federal Goverment Girls' College, Sagamu.</h3> Here, I had my Senior Secondary education between the years of 2011 and 2014. Before I left taqwa, I took the entrance exams and passed. My parents preferred the school because it is a Fedearal School and my sister went there. I was in Ayoola(Orange) House, and in "P" arm. There is a lot more to say about this school, but I'd leave that for another time and place.
      </div>
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3>4. Heritage Homeschool.</h3> Here, I took on an A'Level course, because I could not go into the University immediately. It was also a muslim school. Once again, I will one day go into detail about all that went on in this school, but today is not that day. My A'Level result was just average and not good enough to go into the University through Direct Entry, so I rewrote JAMB and had a score of 277. EFIWE!
      </div>
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3> 5. University of Lagos.</h3> Here, I got admission to study Law. I maintained my Efiwe status, but struggled a lot towards the end. I graduated with a Second class Lower and it still haunts me to this day. 
      </div>
      <div class= "col-lg-6 col-sm-12"><h3>5. HTML, CSS & Javascript for Web Developers, Coursera</h3>
      After a brief flirtation with Python, I decided to segue into Web Development. It was after taking this course that I decided to test my knowledge and create this website. I am still really struggling with Javascript, but so far, so good.
